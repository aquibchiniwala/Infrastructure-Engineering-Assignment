Part 1.
 
The program scans all the Drives and folders like C:/User/* (Windows) and /home/* (Linux) recursively and
then identify the top 10 files which have the largest size on the system. (BY DEFAULT).

if want to scan specified directory,

Enter the directory path in which you want to search top 10 largest files.

else just press ENTER to scan DEFAULT PATH [C:/User/* (Windows) and /home/* (Linux)].

Part 2.

The tool sorts the files on Desktop on the basis of file extension and move them in
separate folders in Documents folder.

Thank you.
